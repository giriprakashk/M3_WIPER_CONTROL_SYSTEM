# Introduction
In vehicles, a wiper control system uses an electronic component to replace the typical wiper blade. A single switch in the ACC position will control the ignition button (on the motor) with this design. With a second push, switch on the wiper system, then change the wiper speed with a third press, and then turn off the motor with a fourth press. LEDs and a simulation tool were used to accomplish this. A wiper is an important component that removes rain or any other liquid from a vehicle's windscreen. The former system needed manual wiper activation, which was difficult to do. As a result, this technology is being touted as a potential solution to these issues.The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions. A converter converts the analogue sensor signal into a digital pulse signal for use in a digital circuit system. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it.
