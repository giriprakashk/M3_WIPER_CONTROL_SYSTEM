# Abstract
A wiper is an important component that removes rain or any other liquid from a vehicle's windscreen. The former system needed manual wiper activation, which was difficult to do. As a result, this technology is being touted as a potential solution to these issues. The project's aims are to provide wiping systems for older cars, enhance the system with actuators and pull switches (using the same switch for many purposes by stepwise switching), and control engine and wiper speed with a single switch. This system adjusts the wiper speed in response to the quantity of rain falling.The functioning speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in response to rain conditions. A rain sensor detects rain conditions in the control system to create. The amplitude of an analogue signal is dependent on the measured rain conditions. A converter converts the analogue sensor output to a digital pulse signal, which is then used in a digital circuit system. By digitally processing the pulse wave, a control signal is created.The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing to match it.The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions. A converter converts the analogue sensor signal into a digital pulse signal for use in a digital circuit system.
# Features
* When the button is pressed ONCE, the automobile will be locked.
* When the button is pressed TWICE, the automobile will open.
* When the button is pressed THREE times, it will turn on and move clockwise.
* When the button is pressed FOUR times, it will wiper off and move in an anticlockwise manner.
* When the button is pressed FIVE times, the wiper will complete one cycle.
